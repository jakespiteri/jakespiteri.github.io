      <description>Numerical Integration Quadrature “Quadrature rules” are integral approximations which use a finite number of evaluations of the function. All of the quadrature rules below approximate a function using interpolating polynomials.
We will first look at some key ideas in numerical integration by approximating definite integrals over a finite interval. We will then extend these ideas to semi-infinite and infinite intervals. We will also consider multiple integrals.
In practice we can use Rs integrate function for one-dimensional integrals, and the cubature package for multiple integrals.</description>

      <description>I am a PhD Student under the COMPASS CDT in the Institute for Statistical Science, University of Bristol. Prior to my PhD I completed an integrated master&amp;rsquo;s degree in Mathematics with Statistics at the University of Bristol.
My research interests include:
  Bayesian methods,
  High-dimensional statistics,
  Computational statistics,
  Graph theory.
