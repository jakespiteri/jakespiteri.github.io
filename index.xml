      <description>I am a final-year PhD student (graduating September 2023) under the COMPASS CDT in the Institute for Statistical Science, University of Bristol. In my research I propose novel methods for statistical inference in latent variable models. My research is supervised by Dr Mathieu Gerber and Professor Anthony Lee. More broadly, I am interested in statistical learning theory and machine learning.
My research interests include:
Computational statistics,
Kernel methods,
Bayesian inference.</description>
