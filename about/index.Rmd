I am currently working as a Quantitative Strategist at BNP Paribas CIB.

I completed my PhD under the [Computational Statistics and Data Science CDT](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/cdt/compass/) in the [Institute for Statistical Science](https://www.bristolmathsresearch.org/statistical-science/), [University of Bristol](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/). My research proposed novel methods for statistical inference in latent variable models. My research was supervised by [Dr Mathieu Gerber](https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/persons/mathieu-gerber) and [Professor Anthony Lee](https://sites.google.com/view/anthonylee). My work deepened my interest in statistical learning theory and machine learning, areas that continue to inform my professional endeavors.

My key research interests include:

- Computational statistics,

- Kernel methods,

- Bayesian inference.

Prior to my PhD I completed an integrated masterâ€™s degree in Mathematics with Statistics at the University of Bristol. My master's thesis was on outlier detection in time-varying networks.

## Teaching
I was a Graduate Teacher for Financial Mathematics, Financial Risk Management, Probability & Statistics, and Bayesian Modelling in the School of Mathematics. I was also a Teaching Assistant on the Statistical Computing and Empirical Methods unit offered by the School of Engineering for the MSc in Data Science.
