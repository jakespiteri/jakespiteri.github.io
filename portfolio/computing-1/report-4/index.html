In vectorizing code, the multiple instructions running the same operation in a for loop are replaced by a single instruction which applies the operation to multiple elements in a vector.\nVectorization is much faster than using for loops in interpreted languages such as R, Matlab, and Python. To see this in practice, we will look at some examples.\nWe consider summing the cosine of each component of a vector.\n# set the seed for reproducibility set.seed(123) # uses a for loop add_cos1 \u003c- function(x) { sum \u003c- 0 for (i in 1:length(x)) { sum \u003c- sum + cos(x[i]) } return(sum) } # uses vectorization add_cos2 \u003c- function(x) sum(cos(x)) x = 1:1e7 t1 \u003c- system.time(add_cos1(x)) t2 \u003c- system.time(add_cos2(x)) t1 ## user system elapsed ## 1.138 0.000 1.146 t2 ## user system elapsed ## 0.310 0.076 0.391 At the time of running, this provided a speedup of 2.9 times. We also note that the vectorized code is also easier to read.\nHigh-dimensional vectorization The example above shows that for loops are quite inefficient. It is now easy to see that nested for loops are very inefficient, and should be avoided.\nThere are many reasons we may want to use nested for loops. We may want to run a simulation \\(n_{sim}\\) times, where each simulation consists of \\(n\\) operations.\nAs an example, we consider the average value produced by tossing a fair six-sided die \\(n=500\\) times. We expect our data to center around \\(\\frac{1+2+3+4+5+6}{6}=3.5\\). We simulate the experiment \\(n_{sim} = 1000\\) times.\ntoss_die1 \u003c- function(nsim, n) { average \u003c- numeric(nsim) for (i in 1:nsim) { counts \u003c- numeric(n) for (j in 1:n) { counts[j] \u003c- sample(1:6, 1) } average[i] \u003c- mean(counts) } return(average) } toss_die2 \u003c- function(nsim, n) { tosses \u003c- matrix(sample(1:6, n*nsim, replace=TRUE), nrow=nsim, ncol=n) return(rowSums(tosses)/n) } We now test the runtime of the nested for loop version, and the vectorized version.\nnsim \u003c- 1000; n \u003c- 500 t1 \u003c- system.time(toss_die1(nsim, n)); t1 ## user system elapsed ## 4.047 0.008 4.081 t2 \u003c- system.time(toss_die2(nsim, n)); t2 ## user system elapsed ## 0.045 0.000 0.046 We see that nested for loops are very slow and should be avoided when possible. In this case the vectorized code provides a speedup of 89 times! We will use the vectorized function in the following.\nnsim \u003c- 10000; n \u003c- 500 average_value \u003c- toss_die2(nsim,n) hist(average_value, breaks = 30) Let’s look at a demonstration of Law of Large Numbers. We plot the cumulative mean as the number of throws increases.\nnsim \u003c- 3000; n \u003c- 1 plot(1:nsim, cumsum(toss_die2(nsim, n))/1:nsim, type = 'l', main='Average dice roll', xlab = 'Number of rolls', ylab='Cumulative mean') abline(h=3.5, col='red', lty = 2) The apply family The apply family consists of apply(), lapply(), sapply(), and mapply(). These functions apply a specified function to elements in a data structure. These functions can be viewed as alternatives to for loops; they are often slower but may simplify and enhance the readability of code.\napply(X, MARGIN, FUN, ...) — This function applies a function to a vector or matrix. The MARGIN argument determines whether the function is applied over rows or columns, or both.\nlapply(X, FUN, ...) — This function is similar to apply but it applies a function over a vector or list and returns a list.\nsapply(X, FUN, ...) — This is a wrapper function of lapply which simplifies the output by returning a vector, matrix, or an array when specified using simplify = \"array\".\nmapply(FUN, ...) — This is a multivariate version of sapply. mapply applies the function FUN to the first elements of each subsequent ... argument.\nExamples Below are some examples using the apply family of functions.\n## apply mat \u003c- matrix(rep(1, 12), 3, 4) # 3x4 matrix of 1s # apply sum to each row --- i.e. sum over columns apply(mat, 1, sum) ## [1] 4 4 4 # apply sum to each column --- i.e. sum over rows apply(mat, 2, sum) ## [1] 3 3 3 3 # apply sum to each element --- this does not do anything if FUN = sum apply(mat, c(1,2), sum) ## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] ## [1,] 1 1 1 1 ## [2,] 1 1 1 1 ## [3,] 1 1 1 1 # apply our own function to each element apply(mat, c(1,2), function(x) 2*x) ## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] ## [1,] 2 2 2 2 ## [2,] 2 2 2 2 ## [3,] 2 2 2 2 ## lapply vec \u003c- rep(1,3) lis \u003c- list(seq = 1:4, rep = rep(1,4)) # get cosine of each element in a vector lapply(vec, cos) ## [[1]] ## [1] 0.5403023 ## ## [[2]] ## [1] 0.5403023 ## ## [[3]] ## [1] 0.5403023 # apply cosine to list lapply(lis, cos) ## $seq ## [1] 0.5403023 -0.4161468 -0.9899925 -0.6536436 ## ## $rep ## [1] 0.5403023 0.5403023 0.5403023 0.5403023 ## sapply # get cosine of each element in a vector sapply(vec, cos) ## [1] 0.5403023 0.5403023 0.5403023 # apply cosine to list sapply(lis, cos) ## seq rep ## [1,] 0.5403023 0.5403023 ## [2,] -0.4161468 0.5403023 ## [3,] -0.9899925 0.5403023 ## [4,] -0.6536436 0.5403023 ## mapply # sum two vectors elementwise mapply('+', 1:3, 4:6) ## [1] 5 7 9 # seq(1, 5), seq(2, 5), ... mapply(seq, 1:5, 5) ## [[1]] ## [1] 1 2 3 4 5 ## ## [[2]] ## [1] 2 3 4 5 ## ## [[3]] ## [1] 3 4 5 ## ## [[4]] ## [1] 4 5 ## ## [[5]] ## [1] 5 Map, Reduce, and Filter These functions can use lambda expressions similar to the above apply family. These are short functions which are sometimes referred to as anonymous functions, as they are not assigned to a variable. Lambda expressions allow us to produce quite complicated functionality in one line.\nBelow is a quick summary of the functions introduced in this section:\nMap — This function maps a function to every element in a vector.\nReduce — This function performs a function on pairs of elements in a vector, iteratively, and returns a single number.\nFilter — Tests every element in a vector and only returns those that satisfy the condition.\nExamples Below are some examples demonstrating the above functions.\nvec \u003c- 1:3 # Map cosine to every element in a vector Map(cos, vec) ## [[1]] ## [1] 0.5403023 ## ## [[2]] ## [1] -0.4161468 ## ## [[3]] ## [1] -0.9899925 # Reduce Reduce(function(x, y) x + 2*y, vec) ## [1] 11 # Filter Filter(function(x) x %% 3 == 0, vec) ## [1] 3 Parallel computing Parallelization is the process of using multiple CPU cores at the same time, to solve different parts of a problem. Often when working on large computational problems, we will encounter a bottleneck. We may encounter a\nCPU-bound: Our computations take too much CPU time. Memory-bound: Our computations use too much memory. I/O bound: It takes too long to read/write from disk. Parallel computing helps us overcome CPU bounds by working with more than one core at a time. This means that if our computer has four physical cores, then we can distribute our computation across four cores. In theory, this would speed up our computation by four times but it is not the case in practice due to the other bounds described above. Part of being a good R programmer is being able to write fast and efficient code.\nParallelize using mclapply mclapply is a multi-core version of lapply.\nlibrary(parallel) library(doParallel) ## Loading required package: foreach ## Loading required package: iterators # detect cores detectCores() ## [1] 8 # demonstrate that distributing over 4 cores does not provide speed up of 4 times system.time(lapply(1:8, function(x) Sys.sleep(0.5))) # 4 seconds ## user system elapsed ## 0.004 0.000 4.009 system.time(mclapply(1:8, function(x) Sys.sleep(0.5), mc.cores=4)) # expect 1 second ## user system elapsed ## 0.012 0.008 1.019 Parallelize using foreach foreach seems a little like a for loop. However foreach uses binary operators %do% and %dopar%, and also returns a list as output. It’s useful to use foreach with %do% to evaluate an expression sequentially and store all outputs in a data struture — by default this is a list but the behavior can be changed using the argument .combine.\nlibrary(foreach) # run sequentially using %do% foreach(i=1:3) %do% {i*i} ## [[1]] ## [1] 1 ## ## [[2]] ## [1] 4 ## ## [[3]] ## [1] 9 # change output to vector foreach(i=1:3, .combine=\"c\") %do% {i*i} ## [1] 1 4 9 The above functions use the operator %do% and therefore run sequentially. If we simply replace the operator with %dopar% R will run the computations in parallel. The above computations are so simple that it’s probably not worth implementing them in parallel. Let’s look at a little example using Markov chain Monte Carlo, in which we may want to run multiple chains to test for pseudo-convergence. All of the parallelization is in the simulate.chains function. Note that in order to run the computations in parallel we must register the parallel backend using registerDoParallel() before foreach. When we are finished we should run stopImplicitCluster().\n# returns the transition kernel P(x) make.metropolis.hastings.kernel \u003c- function(pi, Q) { q \u003c- Q$density P \u003c- function(x) { z \u003c- Q$sample(x) alpha \u003c- min(1, pi(z) * q(z, x) / pi(x) / q(x, z)) if(runif(1) \u003c alpha) { return(z) } else { return(x) } } return(P) } make.normal.proposal \u003c- function(sigma) { Q \u003c- list() Q$sample \u003c- function(x) { return(rnorm(length(x), x, sigma)) } Q$density \u003c- function(x, z) { return(dnorm(z, x, sigma)) } return(Q) } simulate.chains \u003c- function(P, x0, n, n.chains, n.cores = 4) { # parallelize chains registerDoParallel(n.cores) simulations \u003c- foreach(i=1:n.chains, .combine=\"rbind\") %dopar% { x \u003c- x0[i] foreach(i=1:n, .combine=\"c\") %do% {P(x)} } stopImplicitCluster() return(simulations) } Below we sample from a mixture distribution: The weighted mixture of two normal distributions \\({Z \\sim 0.6X + 0.4Y}\\), where \\(X \\sim N(-2,1)\\), \\(Y \\sim N(5, 2^2)\\). We use a \\(N(0,1)\\) proposal distribution. We will run \\(4\\) chains in parallel and test for pseudo-convergence by looking at the trace of the chains. Each chain is initialized using a \\(U[-10,10]\\) distribution.\n# generate markov chain using MH algorithm # target: mixture of two normals n \u003c- 5e3; set.seed(123) target \u003c- function(x) {0.6*dnorm(x, -2, 1) + 0.4*dnorm(x, 5, 2)} xs \u003c- simulate.chains(make.metropolis.hastings.kernel(target, make.normal.proposal(1)), runif(4,-10,10), n, 4) # setup plot space par(mfrow=c(2,2)) # plot the chains ylimits \u003c- c(min(xs), max(xs)) for(i in 1:4){ plot(1:n, xs[i,], type = 'l', xlab=\"iteration\", ylim=ylimits, ylab=\"x\", main=paste0(\"Trace of Markov chain \", i)) } We see that the traces do not converge to the same distribution! This tells us that the chains are not fully exploring the state space and thus we must adjust our proposal distribution.\n","wordCount":"1781","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Jake Spiteri"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://jakespiteri.co.uk/portfolio/computing-1/report-4/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Jake Spiteri","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://jakespiteri.co.uk/favi.png"}}}</script></head><body id=top><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://jakespiteri.co.uk/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><div class=custom-logo><span class=logo__mark></span>

This means that if our computer has four physical cores, then we can distribute our computation across four cores. In theory, this would speed up our computation by four times but it is not the case in practice due to the other bounds described above.

However <code>foreach</code> uses binary operators <code>%do%</code> and <code>%dopar%</code>, and also returns a list as output. It’s useful to use <code>foreach</code> with <code>%do%</code> to evaluate an expression sequentially and store all outputs in a data struture — by default this is a list but the behavior can be changed using the argument <code>.combine</code>.</p><pre class=r><code>library(foreach)
